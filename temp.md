❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without these variables being defined or passed as arguments. This
will lead to an error because `a` and `b` are not in scope.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b){ return a + b; }
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now takes `a` and `b` as parameters, so it can correctly add the two numbers passed to it.
* ✔ The function can be called with arguments, e.g., `sum(5, 3)` will return 8.
